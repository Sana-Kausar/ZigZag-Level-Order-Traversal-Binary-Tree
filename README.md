# ZigZag-Level-Order-Traversal-Binary-Tree

Problem Description
Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes values. (ie, from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

Problem Constraints
1 <= number of nodes <= 105

Input Format
First and only argument is root node of the binary tree, A.

Output Format
Return a 2D integer array denoting the zigzag level order traversal of the given binary tree.
